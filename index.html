                <p style="font-family: Varela Round, sans-serif">There are many reasons why Basement Waterproofing is a good idea. If you're among the many homeowners who dread the rain or snow because you know what it will do to your basement, it's time to take action. Your basement can be a great addition to your home, but when you aren't able to take full advantage of it, it can lead to headaches and disappointment. Take basement waterproofing into your own hands and be done with the problem once and for all.</p>

                <p><div class="holder"><img class="water" src="images/water_table.jpg" alt="Basement Waterproofing image"></div>Unfortunately, most all houses will at some point face the inevitable issue of water penetration into the basement. Basements are underground, and eventually water will find its way in. 3 Brothers Waterproofing has been tackling water intrusion issues for a long, long time now, and we don't plan on stopping any time soon. There is no cookie-cutter solution or method for keeping your home dry and mold-free. Your water problem is different than your neighbors water problem. That is exactly what separates us from the rest. We install a waterproofing system based on the actual problem, not a "standard" problem. Go to our <a href="waterproofing.html" style="text-decoration: none; color: #000; background: #ffff00">Waterproofing</a> page to learn more about our Waterproofing methods, and our <a href="outside.html" style="background: #ffff00; color: #000">Outside Drainage</a> page for a very detailed and in-depth look at just what waterproofing is.

It's gross - it's nasty - it's hazardous to your health. Mold or mildew or fungus, or whatever adjective you choose to describe it, all equates to the same thing - AVOID THIS STUFF!! Mold comes in a vast variety of many different species, and some molds can even be invisible to the human eye, and wreak havoc not only on your home, but also on your health. Different molds require different treatments. 85% of mold is invisible, and while you think everything is honky-dory, in actuality, there may be a science experiment going on behind your walls, under your carpet, in your ducts, etc. Without having a professional come in to let you know at least if there MIGHT be something causing a mold issue, you're left in a potentially dangerous sitation. If you so much as suspect something, don't brush it under the rug! Consultations are free. Call us!! Check out our <a href="#" style="text-decoration: none; color: #000; background: #ffff00">Mold Remediation</a> page and our <a href="mold-faq.html" style="background: #ffff00; color: #000">Mold FAQ</a>page...</p>

                <p><div class="holder2"><img class="water" src="images/radon.png" style="width: 260px; height: 220px" alt="Radon Gas image"></div>Radon falls under the same category of mold as far as hazardous goes. Except it may be a few levels higher. Radon is classified as a potentially dangerous gas that cannot be seen, smelled, or tasted. Having all those characteristics is exactly why homeowners' concern for Radon inside a home is usually low. You see, Radon is a radioactive gas. and its chemical makeup can spell bad news if its found in higher quantities in your home. As far as Radon in homes, that aspect is now getting more popular, and that is a good thing, as to become certified in Radon control, is not an easy process. To be certified takes alot of learning and alot of schooling, and we are excited to be one of the very few companies that will be dealing with Radon mitigation. If you are dealing with a company that offers Radon systems, you can rest assured that the process to get that certification was tedious, and you can feel comfortable knowing you're in good hands. See our <a href="#" style="text-decoration: none">Radon</a> page for more.</p> -->
                

<h2 class="title" style="font-family: Varela Round, sans-serif; text-shadow: none">Why Choose 3 Brothers Waterproofing?</h2>
                <!-- <p style="font-family: Varela Round, sans-serif">Besides the obvious requisite of being <strong>Fully Licensed & Insured</strong>, this would be a perfect little area to fill with generic clichès about how awesome we are at what we do. And even though we just subliminally did in fact tell you how awesome we are at what we do, we would much rather let our work and reputation do the talking. <strong>Our prices - our quality - our craftsmanship - our integrity - heck, even our materials & supplies, are THE industry standards!</strong> Believe it or not, there are lots of companies of the same genre that will promise you the world, and make you believe you'll get it too, and when all is said and done, they will come to your house with some sub-contractors, with the "best deal possible" kind of supplies, and start doing work on what is realistically a very large and precise project. We've been around since 1967, and we've seen alot of companies come and go. Some companies are out to make a quick buck, and others just didn't fully grasp how vital is to maintain a well-oiled machine in all aspects of waterproofing and mold removal. Full disclosure here: <strong>Basement Waterproofing is NOT a small project and is NOT a quick solution</strong>. Granted, there are plenty of quick fixes and band-aids to keep your basement from leaking, but 3 Brothers Waterproofing won't do the work unless we can guarantee it for life! There are fast solutions, and then there is Basement Waterproofing done by <strong>Elite Basement Solutions</strong>. And what now about that sub-contractor thing we mentioned? Well, when a company uses sub-contractors to do the work, they are basically selling you the job, hiring another "company of sorts" to do the work, then come back to collect the check. Not only does this make the lines of communication between the customer and the original company you hired harder, but if there are any problems with the work after the fact, needless to say it is much harder to get those problems rectified. Us? We're family owned, and we are not interested in subbing our work out. <strong>We train our guys, we take care of our guys, and we pay our guys well</strong>, so we want <span style="text-decoration: underline">OUR</span> guys to do the work, so we ourselves will be comfortable during the whole process. We'd rather make a little less money and have more peace-of-mind. Plus, the word-of-mouth referrals we'll get from our customers after the job is done, will make up for the slight profit loss of using our own in-house guys versus saving a few pennies by using sub-contractors, who are basically strangers to us. So, basically, in a nutshell:</p>  -->
